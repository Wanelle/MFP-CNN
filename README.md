Scene classification is a challenging task in computer vision, involving the assignment of semantic labels to images based on their visual content. This paper proposes a Multi-scale Fusion and Pooling Convolutional Neural Network (MFP-CNN) to address the complexities of scene classification, including intraclass diversity, large-scale data processing, and heterogeneous object sizes. To handle the intra-class diversity, we introduce a Lightweight Multi-Stage Feature Fusion (LMSFF) method, effectively capturing multi-scale information and improving feature discriminability. Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SPP) is incorporated to enhance scene representation by considering features at different spatial scales. Moreover, the Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) attention mechanism is employed to focus on informative regions and enhance feature extraction. The attention mechanism allows the model to effectively capture discriminative features and improve classification accuracy. We present the Scene7 dataset, containing diverse real-world scenes with comprehensive annotations for scene classification and object detection tasks. Extensive experiments on the Scene7 dataset validate the effectiveness of our MFP-CNN model, demonstrating superior accuracy and parameter efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods. The proposed MFP-CNN offers a robust and efficient solution for scene classification, contributing to the advancement of computer vision applications.

We present Scene7, a medium-sized dataset specifically curated for scene classification and object detection tasks. This dataset encompasses seven distinct indoor and outdoor life scenes: train interior, car interior, bedroom interior, living room interior, kitchen interior, botanical garden interior, and street interior. Scene7 is designed to cater to diverse research requirements, including the analysis of fast-moving scene analysis.

This is the README for MFP-CNN-for-Scene-Classification
First, you need to replace the scene dataset at the data loading location
Secondly, by modifying the final fully connected layer based on the dataset you added, you can run it directly and obtain the results.
In addition, you can explore the accuracy of the model by modifying the fold count, epoch count, learning rate, and dropout rate of multi fold cross validation.
