We present Scene7, a medium-sized dataset specifically curated for scene classification and object detection tasks.This dataset encompasses seven distinct indoor and outdoor life scenes: train interior, car interior, bedroom interior, living room interior,kitchen interior, botanical garden interior, and street interior. Scene7 is designed to cater to diverse research requirements, including the analysis of fast-moving scene analysis.
To compile the Scene7 dataset, we gather images from various sources, including the internet, real-world scenes, and the publicly available SUN397 scene dataset. Our data collection process involves extracting relevant scene images from the SUN397 dataset and supplementing them with additional images acquired through web crawlers. We then meticulously filter out inappropriate and duplicate images, resulting in a final dataset of 10,747 images. The distribution of images across different scenes is as follows: 1,435 train interior images, 1,132 car interior images, 1,507 bedroom images, 1,521 living room images, 2,003 kitchen images, 1,669 botanical garden images, and 1,480 street images.
To facilitate object detection tasks, we annotate a subset of 5,907 images from the seven scene categories. The “make-sense” online tool is utilized for labeling object categories ofinterest in the dataset images, resulting in a comprehensive dataset suitable for training YOLOv5. A total of 28 objects of interest are selected and labeled, enabling comprehensive detection of real scenes.
