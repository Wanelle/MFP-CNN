# MFP-CNN-for-Scene-Classification
This is the README for MFP-CNN-for-Scene-Classification
First, you need to replace the scene dataset at the data loading location
Secondly, by modifying the final fully connected layer based on the dataset you added, you can run it directly and obtain the results.
In addition, you can explore the accuracy of the model by modifying the fold count, epoch count, learning rate, and dropout rate of multi fold cross validation.
